# Swiftly-Found
"Swiftly Found" is a desktop application for Taylor Swift fans who want to easily find and purchase Taylor Swift merchandise. The name is a play on words from "Swift" and "Quickly Found". This application uses web scraping techniques to request information from the original Taylor Swift merchandise site and display it in an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Built with Electron, this application provides users with a native desktop experience across multiple platforms.

With "Swiftly Found", you can browse through a wide selection of Taylor Swift merchandise and filter by category, price, and more. You can also add items to your cart and checkout securely. The app is under development and I am currently exploring which additional technologies to use.

Whether you're a die-hard Taylor Swift fan or simply looking for some unique and high-quality merchandise, "Swiftly Found" is the perfect place to find your next favorite item.

Also, I would to point out that this project is for educational purposes.
